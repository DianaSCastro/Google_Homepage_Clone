## 1.Intro

HTML5 works hand in hand with CSS3 to create web pages that we use every day in the browser. Even the website where you right now have content that was built with HTML and CSS. In this project with my knowledge of HTML and CSS, I cloned the Google homepage interface.

## 2. What I build?

In this project, I focused on building the static Google interface. Contains the following sections:

* **Header Section:** includes the profile photo, icons, Google logo and the main areas of the site.
* **Main Container section:** for the central elements of the page.
* **Footer Section:** includes hyperlinks at the bottom of the page.

Learn to use the standard HTML5 tags and CSS3 styles.
